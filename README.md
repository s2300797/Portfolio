# Portfolio

I am a Finnish game developer 💀

In this portfolio I have some of the music and games I have made in my sad little nub of a lifetime.

I DO have a sense of humor, you just won't get it :)

## About Me (Lore)

Hello. I make games. Sometimes they even work.

I’m a Finland-based game developer with an unhealthy interest in game feel, sound design, graphics and making small ideas way more complicated than they need to be. I enjoy experimenting, breaking things, (Making others) fix them, and then breaking them again in a more interesting way.

I like projects that sit somewhere between *"this is kind of dumb"* and *"wait, this actually slaps."* If that sounds intentional, good. If not, even better.
(I also appreciate beautiful games with indepth game design, like Minecraft, Subnautica, Marvel's Spider-Man and Days Gone.

## What I Do

* 🧪 **Game Design** - design... Hours of design and brainstorming
* 🎮 **Game Development** – gameplay programming, prototyping, mechanics, and systems
* 🎵 **Music & Audio** – original tracks, loops, sound effects, and vibes
* 🧑🏻‍🎨 **Graphics** - mainly pixel art


---

## Tools of the Trade

Things I have willingly chosen to spend time with:

* Game Engines: Unity (and the emotional damage it brings)
* Languages: C#, Python, and a little bit of "why is this not working"
* Audio: DAWs, synths, samplers, headphones on too loud
* Other: Git, Blender (on good days), Stack Overflow

### Project: [Project Bloodmoon]

A game where:

* You Collect materials, build tools and bases, survive against hordes of zombies and mutants, all while the cold Alaskan winter approaches.

**What I worked on:**

* Lead designer
* Music
* I really tried to code 😭 I really tried....

**What I learned:**

* That workin on UI is very confusing, and not fit for me...
* That it's pretty nice to have people who actually sometimes know what they're doing (None of us did)

## Music

I also make music, because silence is scary.

Genres range from:

* Ambient
* Electronic
* Game-y noises
* "This would loop nicely in a menu"

Music is usually made with games in mind, but sometimes it just exists. That’s allowed.

---

## Philosophy (Very Serious)

* Games should feel good to play (I just don't know how)
* Audio matters more than people think (It's underrated)
* If it’s fun, it’s not a waste of time

Thanks for reading.
If you didn’t get the humor, that’s on brand.
